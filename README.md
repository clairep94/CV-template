<!-- A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech. -->

I am a training full-stack developer and current recipient of the `Represent Scholarship` by `codebar.io` for `Makers Academy`. Previous to my journey in tech, I was a fashion designer and have designed for luxury brands such as `Burberry`, `Celine`, and `A-Cold-Wall`. 

At my core, I am a maker, whether it is an elegant piece of software or beautiful piece of clothing. I have experience leading design teams, and I can take complete ownership of a product from research to concept to design development to prototype and production launch. I am detail oriented, love puzzles and thinking of systematic solutions. Tech gives me the opportunity to combine my creativity, love of making, and analytical problem-solving skills.

## Work Experience

**Makers Academy** (Sept '23 to Jan '23)  
_Student Full-Stack Developer_

- Wrote web-based full-stack applications in both Python (Flask) and Javascript (MERN). Experienced in designing and writing a relational database from scratch with PostgreSQL.

- Developed personal weekly projects with a focus on OOP, TTD, and considered architecture to create code that is well-tested, easy to read, maintain, and scale.

- Worked collaboratively on team projects in an Agile environment (including SCRUM, Pair Programming, Kanban, etc.) to efficiently reach MVPs, implement new features, and deploy them in a CI-CD approach.

- Adept at independently interpreting Briefs and User Stories into project architecture and can confidently solve logistical problems with software.

**DOM REBEL** (Jul '22 to Sept '23)  
_Lead Designer_

- Lead a team of assistant designers, in-house artists, and freelancers to create collections of over 60 products per season. From my involvement, the brand has gained world-reknowned luxury department stores `Selfridges` and `Harrods` among their stockists.

- Strong research skills and can take ownership of developing products from concept, to design & development, to prototype and deployment.

- This role gave me skills directly applicable to designing a software engineering product from scratch. I am adept at interpretting a high-level brief into concrete project components. I can own products from end-to-end, and design solutions with both technical efficiency and brand-alignment in mind.

**A-Cold-Wall*** (Aug '21 to Oct '22, Jan '23)  
_Freelance Technical Designer_

- Created technical packages, with diagrams and specifications for the construction, material, wash, print, and trims of each product.

- This role is similar to OO analysis and design for software engineering. I am well-practiced in breaking down a product design into separate components with its own spec details and dependencies. I can communicate these technical details through well-drawn diagrams and clearly-written specifications to a third party.

**Burberry** (Sept '20 to Sept '21)  
_Menswear Design Assistant, Mainline Wovens_

- Supported the Menswear Mainline team with creating CAD designs, updating design boards, and amending designs, staying adaptive to ongoing feedback from the Creative Director.

- This role is directly applicable to Agile methodology in software engineering. I am adept at making incremental changes to meet client feedback, and can handle multiple tickets in a fast-paced environment.

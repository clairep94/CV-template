## Claire Peng


I am a junior full-stack developer and current recipient of the `Represent Scholarship` by `codebar.io` for `Makers Academy`. Previous to my journey in tech, I was a fashion designer and have designed for luxury brands such as `Burberry`, `Celine`, and `A-Cold-Wall`. 

At my core, I love to make things, whether it is an elegant piece of software or beautiful piece of clothing. I thrive in high-paced environments that require adaptability, can take complete ownership of a product from research to development to launch, and have experience working in teams to build test-driven apps using the MERN stack, Python & Flask.

## Work Experience

**Makers Academy** (Sept '23 to Jan '23)  
_Student Full-Stack Developer_

- Created full-stack web applications in Python and Javascript with a focus on OOP, TTD, and considered project architecture to create code that is well-tested, easy to read, maintain and scale.
  
- **Frontend:** Designed and developed visually cohesive components using React.js and TailwindCSS. Taught myself websockets to add live-chat and live-move features as personal extensions of the OppoGames and Acebook projects.
  
- **Backend:** Interpreted high-level User Stories into relational and non-relational database designs, and created test-driven RESTful APIs in Python/Flask and Node.js/Express.

- **Teamwork:** Worked collaboratively on team projects in an Agile environment (including SCRUM, Pair Programming, Kanban, etc.) to efficiently reach MVPs, implement new features, and deploy them in a CI-CD approach.

**DOM REBEL** (Jul '22 to Sept '23)  
_Lead Designer_

- Lead a team of assistant designers, in-house artists, and freelancers to create collections of over 60 products per season. From my involvement, the brand has gained world-reknowned luxury department stores `Selfridges` and `Harrods` among their stockists.

- Strong research skills and can take ownership of developing products from concept, to design & development, to prototype and deployment.

- This role gave me directly applicable skills to designing a software engineering product from scratch. I am adept at interpretting a high-level brief into concrete project components. I can own products from end-to-end, and design solutions with both technical efficiency and brand-alignment in mind.

**A-Cold-Wall*** (Aug '21 to Oct '22, Jan '23)  
_Freelance Technical Designer_

- Created technical packages, with diagrams and specifications for the construction, material, wash, print, and trims of each product.

- This role is similar to BE database and FE component system design for software engineering. I am well-practiced in breaking down a product into separate components with its own spec details and interlinking dependencies. I can communicate these technical details clearly to a third party, both through text and diagrams.

**Burberry** (Sept '20 to Sept '21)  
_Menswear Design Assistant, Mainline Wovens_

- Supported the Menswear Mainline team with creating CAD designs, updating design boards, and amending designs, staying adaptive to ongoing feedback from the Creative Director.

- This role is directly applicable to Agile methodology in software engineering. I am adept at making incremental changes to meet client feedback, and can handle multiple tickets in a fast-paced environment.

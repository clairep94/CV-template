<!-- A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech. -->

I am a training full-stack developer and `codebar.io` Represent Scholarship student at `Makers Academy`. Previous to my journey in tech, I was a fashion designer and have designed for luxury brands such as `Burberry`, `Celine`, and `A-Cold-Wall`. 

At my heart, I am a maker, whether it is an elegant piece of software or beautiful piece of clothing. I have experience leading design teams, and I can take complete ownership of a product from research to concept to design development to prototype and production launch. I am detail oriented, love puzzles and thinking of systematic solutions. Tech gives me the opportunity to combine my creativity, love of making, and analytical problem-solving skills.

## Work Experience

**Makers Academy** (Sept '23 to Jan '23)  
_Student Full-Stack Developer_

- Developed weekly projects with a focus on OOP and TTD to create code that is easy to read, scalable and easy to change.

- Worked collaboratively on team projects, and regular pair-programming.

<br>

**DOM REBEL** (Jul '22 to Sept '23)  
_Lead Designer_

- Lead a team of assistant designers, in-house artists, and freelancers to create collections of over 60 products per season. 
<!-- - From my involvement, the brand has gained `Selfridges` and `Harrods` among their stockists. -->
- Strong research skills and can take ownership of developing products from concept to design & development to prototype and deployment.
<!-- - Sensitivity towards design, excellent research skills for what is sticky and eye for cultural trends -->
<br>

**A-Cold-Wall*** (Aug '21 to Oct '22, Jan '23)  
_Freelance Technical Designer_

- Created technical packages, with diagrams and specifications for the construction, material, wash, print, and trims of each product.

- This mental process is similar to ER modelling for software engineering. I am well-practiced in breaking down a product design into separate components with its own spec details and dependencies, and communicating these clearly to a third party.

<br>

**Burberry** (Sept '20 to Sept '21)  
_Menswear Design Assistant, Mainline Wovens_

- Supported the Menswear Mainline team with creating CAD designs, updating design boards, and amending designs, staying adaptive to ongoing feedback from the Creative Director.

- This design process is similar to Agile methodology in software engineering. I am adept at making incremental changes to meet client feedback, and can handle multiple tickets in a fast-paced environment.

## Skills

<!-- Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.  -->
